### Background
Most river system analyses are completed using either intensive, small-area surveys, or extensive, low-resolution surveys. Recent research postulates that both high-resolution and river-extent information is necessary to understand fundamental questions of river processes, such as patterns of critical habitat, sediment links, and river instability. Recent advances in 3D mapping based on photography and sonar, coupled with GPS, and (sometimes) aerial drones is beginning to create data sets which allow this extensive-yet-intensive approach to river understanding. The Next-Generation Riverscape Mapping project will test this approach to riverscape mapping and understanding by developing a open-source, boat-based approach to mapping and measuring  river geometry, sediment size patterns, hydraulic habitats, and riverbank erosion patterns.

### Project Components
 1. **Small mapping boat design**: open-source and garage-build friendly
 2. **River mapping sensor package**: low-cost and (mostly) open-source hardware
 3. **Software**: Python code for collecting and processing data
